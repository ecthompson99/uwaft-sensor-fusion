scenario 1:
    - stationary vehicle, dx = 110, dy = 0
    - ego vehicle, velocity = 4.4704 m/s

scenario 2: Straight single-vehicle deceleration
    - stationary target vehicle, dx = 55, dy = 0
    - ego vehicle, start velocity = 40 kph, linear decrease, end velocity = 0 kph

scenario 3: Straight Multi-vehicle
    - straight road, 150 m
    - 3 target vehicles
        - left, fast, 25 m/s
        - center, medium, 17.5 m/s
        - right, slow, 10 m/s
    - ego vehicle travels at 15 m/s constant
