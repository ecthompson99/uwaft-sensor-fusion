Visualization of OXTS and sensor fusion:
  (using rosbag files, blf files and a oxts dbc as input), go to folder "conversion and visual". Go to "individual" and follow the instructions in that README file. The "conversion and visual" folder also contains scripts to turn oxts and sensor fusion data into a more readable format.
  
"old mat files for binary classification":
  contains .mat files to run the old binary classification(using GM sensor data as ground truth) script called                    "step5_binary_classification.m"
  
"new binary classification":
  contains the script for binary classification working with OXTS as ground truth, also contains .mat files to run the script.
